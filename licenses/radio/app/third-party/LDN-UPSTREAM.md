# Vendored LDN

This directory contains the minimal distributable source for the `ldn` Python
package used by `pokeldn`. It is deliberately tracked in this repository
so a fresh clone has the exact WLAN implementation tested with the project.

## Upstream

- Project: <https://github.com/kinnay/LDN>
- Upstream revision: `39d0b2060c7932ff2766726db7af4fb640cfa9ef`
- Upstream package version: `0.0.17`
- License: GPL-3.0-only; the complete upstream license is in `LICENSE`.

The vendored contents are limited to the package source, packaging metadata,
and license. Upstream Git metadata, examples, documentation, wiki, caches, and
other non-runtime material are intentionally excluded.

## Local compatibility changes

The vendored package incorporates the following project-specific fixes:

- Strip a trailing FCS when Radiotap reports it and accept explicitly opted-in
  Realtek monitor frames that are already CCMP-decrypted but retain CCMP
  metadata (`accept_decrypted_ccmp`).
- Preserve the Ethernet destination when sending frames delegated to
  mac80211/hardware CCMP (`skip_encryption`).
- Mark a station authorized in mac80211 once custom LDN authentication has
  completed.
- Emit useful receive-side exceptions instead of silently suppressing them.

Keep this file current whenever the vendored copy is rebased or modified.

## pokeldn experiment hooks (2026-09-02/03, all default-off)

- `DataFrame` decodes QoS data (subtype 8): TID in the CCMP nonce priority byte and the
  TID-only QoS control in the AAD. Before this every QoS data frame was rejected, which is
  why the `LDN_SWITCH_IES=1` runs (whose WMM element makes the Switch use QoS data) received
  nothing.
- `LDN_SWITCH_IES=1..4`: Switch-host-like beacon / probe / association elements (see the
  comment above `switch_ies_level`); 4 = level 1 without WMM.
- `LDN_BASIC_RATES`: BSS basic rate set via `NL80211_CMD_SET_BSS` after `START_AP`.
- `LDN_DISABLE_HT=1` (station): connect without HT so no BlockAck/A-MPDU session is set up.
